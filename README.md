## Introduction
Face and eye detection is a common use case in image processing. This project utilizes HAAR cascades, a machine learning-based approach for object detection, to detect faces and eyes in images and video streams. The code has been optimized for efficient performance in real-time detection scenarios.

## Features
- **Face detection:** Detects faces in both images and video streams.
- **Eye detection:** Detects eyes within detected faces.
- **Combined detection:** Can detect faces and eyes together for better accuracy.
- **Real-time detection:** Capable of real-time detection through webcam or video input.
- **Optimized code:** Enhanced for faster processing with OpenCV.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HAAR-Cascade-face-detection-openCV.git
    cd HAAR-Cascade-face-detection-openCV
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure you have OpenCV installed:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

## Usage
You can use this project to detect faces and eyes from both images and video streams.

### Detect from an Image
To detect faces and eyes in an image, run the following:
```bash
python detect_from_image.py --image <path_to_image>
```

### Detect from a Video/Webcam
To detect in real-time from a webcam, run:
```bash
python detect_from_video.py
```

You can also use video files as input by providing the path to the video:
```bash
python detect_from_video.py --video <path_to_video>
```

### Available Arguments:
- `--image`: Path to the image file.
- `--video`: Path to the video file or leave blank to use the webcam.
- `--scaleFactor`: Scale factor used in the detection (default is 1.1).
- `--minNeighbors`: Number of neighbors each rectangle should have to retain it (default is 5).
